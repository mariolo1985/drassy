                        I started as an intern working on their iOS app, this is where I learned the ins and outs of product design. We won an app
                        award and I’ve helped the apps team a couple times since then, creating a seamless app experience
                        geared toward the most loyal customers. After a year on apps I moved onto their product navigation
                        page. After joining the team we immediately redesigned the outdated page. It tooks months of research
                        and in addition to creating a cleaner UI and coherent sort/filter system, we were able to cut the
                        load time and improved the search algorithm on the backend. This lead to a long A/B site test and
                        eventual victory over the previous setup in both increasing conversion (~10%) and decreasing bounce
                        rate (~3%).

                    <div class='content'>
                        I started contracting for a few months and continued to help the navigation page while working on some freelance work and
                        personal projects. They offered me to come back full-time and head design on overstock’s Pet adoption
                        site, which was in need of a redesign. After that I moved onto thier real estate sites and did extensive
                        re-design work. In the few years I’ve been at overstock I’ve had the opportunity to touch almost
                        every part of the site and apps, the experience I’ve gained is priceless, both career-wise and personally
                        because I love what I do.

                    <div class='content'>
                        It’s interesting that in the years of working at overstock my process for designing is always changing and is varies based
                        on the project and timeframe. I don’t beleive there is a clear cut process to follow, because in
                        the end we’re really here simply, to solve problems. Ideally the product manager dev lead and I would
                        be working closely and we’d begin by strategizing together and lean on each other’s experience to
                        come up with the next great idea. Those ealry stages of brainstorming it’s good to have a lot of
                        people involved, especially devs, they know the site better than anyone. It’s also good to have every
                        part of the product mapped out clearly. After an idea comes to light, i might send out a survey and
                        do some competitive analysis to see if consumers think the idea is as important as we think it is.
                        I’ve learned that one of the most important skills is knowing when to say “no” to a project. Too
                        often we are the “yes man” and we get into our “process” for a project that was doomed from the start.
                        Then it’s to the drawing board. Depending on both instinct, data, and user feedback the design takes
                        shape. I like to get into prototypes fairly quickly so I can get that real user feedback as soon
                        as possible. I come from an art background, so I enjoy doing the UI for products myself, but when
                        available it’s good to sync with the visual designer as high-fidelity becomes more necessary. I’ve
                        written numerous user tests, both for in-person and online interviews. The earlier and more efficent
                        the usertest, the better direction you get and more money the company saves. In addition to usertests,
                        we have the luxury at Overstock to A/B site test everything that goes out. So after the user research
                        we can compare the various conversion rates and bounce rates of the actual implementation. Ideally
                        the your user friendly design wins over the original, sometimes it’s a choice between the needs of
                        the business (conversion) versus the needs of the user (clarity, ease of use). It’s important to
                        be with the Front End Developers ensuring the quaility of implementation. Any design, no matter how
                        stunning, is useless unless it is feasable, and can be developed properly. Again, it’s all just problem
                        solving and advocating for the consumer, while keeping the business needs in mind. Get along with
                        others, work hard, and never stop learning.
