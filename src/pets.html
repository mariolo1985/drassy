                        Overstock Pets was originally created in 2015 as a way of giving back by providing a free online pet adoption service. 2018
                        they decided to revamp pets with a new look and more features like a social platform, supplies store,
                        and cleaner data. As the project started and we worked to map out the new experience, resources for
                        the project began to be cut and were sparse. We ended up implementig a new design and a very primitive
                        version of what we originally had in mind. We found that we didn’t have the resources to clean the
                        data so we had to bend the design and functionality around what already existed. The site structure
                        we had laid out and the new features ,such as the social platform, we had created were obsolete.
                        Overall, it was a fun project to work on, but the lack of resources really downsized the original
                        vision, but at the very least the experience was improved and Pets now had a brand of it’s own, I
                        hope the site gets some love in the future. It was quite an eye opening project to see the need shelter’s
                        have to get these animals adopted. It was a pleasure to work on something that was focused on an
                        ethical cause rather than the money.
